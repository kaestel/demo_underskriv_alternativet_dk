# About this demo

This demo is a frontend only version of the voter-declaration signing application originally launched on https://underskriv.alternativet.dk. 
The website was launched in 2014 and used to collect signatures allowing newly established political party, Alternativet, to run for parliament. This application was the first digital solution to be approved by the Ministry of interior affairs.

The website may no longer be available online in it's original form. It is shared here, in this form, as an example of the frontend work I have done over the years.

This demo only exposes the source code that was online at the time of launch, and as such publicly available. 
It is published here with the same copyright as for the original website.
